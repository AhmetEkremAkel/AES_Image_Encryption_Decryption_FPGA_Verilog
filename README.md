# 🔐 AES Image Encryption & Decryption on FPGA (Verilog)

This repository presents a hardware-based implementation of AES-128 encryption and decryption for colored images using FPGA. The design is written in Verilog and tested on a Xilinx Nexys A7-100T development board via UART interface.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to realize a real-time, AES encryption-decryption system tailored for RGB image data. The core AES algorithm is fully implemented in Verilog, including key expansion, and optimized for hardware resource efficiency.

The input image is parametric, serialized via UART, encrypted on the FPGA, and transmitted back for decryption and verification.

## 🔐 AES Algorithm Summary

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), originally named Rijndael, is a symmetric block cipher standardized by NIST in 2001. In AES-128:

Operates on 128-bit data blocks

Utilizes 128-bit symmetric keys

Performs 10 transformation rounds:

SubBytes

ShiftRows

MixColumns (except final round)

AddRoundKey

Key expansion generates 11 round keys (1 initial + 10 rounds)

AES counter mode :

##⚙️ FPGA Architecture

The project consists of modular and synchronous hardware blocks:

UART Interface: For image data transmission between PC and FPGA

AES Core: Implements round transformations (SubBytes, ShiftRows, etc.)

Key Expansion: FSM-controlled round key generation

Control FSM: Manages pipeline and data flow across AES and UART modules

## 🧩 UART-based Image Encryption Flow

RGB image is loaded and zero-padded in MATLAB

Image is partitioned into 8×8 blocks

Blocks are sent sequentially via UART to the FPGA

FPGA encrypts each block using AES-128

Encrypted data is returned via UART for reconstruction or decryption

## ⚡ Why FPGA?

Low Latency, Real-Time Processing: Deterministic throughput per clock cycle

Hardware-Level Key Security: Secrets stay isolated from system software

Power Efficiency: Custom hardware reduces unnecessary switching

Reconfigurability: Design can be modified and retargeted easily
